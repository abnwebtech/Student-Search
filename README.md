**If you not at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) then this is of NO USE to you! You may leave now, or if interested continue. But let me warn you in the beginning, you won't be able to visit it from any network outside IITK.**

Well, so IITK students must be wondering why this now, when I already had made a student search 1.5 years back. My answer to them is that I wanted to develop a full fledged CodeIgniter app, so this is it!

*I have developed it sheer for timepass (blame the boring week at home), so if you are a developer, instead of suggesting edits/changes to me over mail, as many of you have been doing, now may send pull requests here, & I will add them to the site.*

***Some new features of this over the previous version:***

 - It works from any proxy within IITK. Now you don't have to switch to no-proxy each time!
 
 - Open Source, so anyone with a bit of knowledge of Web Technologies can contribute.
 
 - Student data cannot be selected by selecting them normally by cursor (maybe to prevent the copying of mailing lists)
 
 - If you want to search for a single student given his email id or roll number, you dont have to enter in the text box, **search directly via url, like http://h4ckcod3r.in/student_search/search/10585 or http://h4ckcod3r.in/student_search/search/gopi** Time saviour!
 
 - Dynamic search, see the results as you type.
